Overview:
This project aims to design and implement a 2-bit comparator using the VSDSquadron Mini board. A 2-bit comparator is a digital circuit that compares two 2-bit binary numbers and indicates whether one number is greater than, less than, or equal to the other. The project involves designing the comparator logic using C programming in Visual Studio Code, setting up the hardware connections on a breadboard, and verifying the functionality through LEDs connected to the output.

Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to: Design a 2-bit comparator using C programming.
Implement the designed comparator on the VSDSquadron Mini board.
Verify the correct functionality of the comparator by using LEDs to display the comparison results.
Gain hands-on experience in digital circuit design, C programming, and hardware implementation.

Key Components:
VSDSquadron Mini Board : The main microcontroller board used for processing and logic implementation.
Breadboard and Jumper Wires : For building and testing the circuit.
LEDs : To display the comparison results.This project requires 3 LEDs.
Resistors : To limit the current to the LEDs.220Ohm resistors are used in this project.
